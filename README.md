# Maze-solving-Algorithms-simulation-in-C
#Description
This repository contains three mazes that can be solved using the algorithms implemented in C. All these algorithms work through an API to simulate the maze environment and navigate through it. These algorithms are the Flood-Fill, which is able to obtain good routes moving throughout the maze in systematic paths, the Right-Hand Rule (RH), which follows the right wall and the Left-Hand Rule (LH), which follows the left wall. Each algorithm has its own different technique that has evolved beyond mere wall-following to more complicated path finding methods.
#Algorithms
_Flood Fill Algorithm_
Flood-fill is the algorithmic maze solver that methodically searches every possible path to the goal. It assigns travel distance values to each cell, continuously modifying them on the basis of adjacent paths. The rule operation thus finds the shortest and the most efficient route thereby increasing the efficacy of the algorithm with which complex mazes can be solved and enhanced with the navigation.
